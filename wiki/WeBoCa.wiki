= Introduction =

WeBoCa? is an advanced and altered implementation of JBootCat (a Java implemention of the BootCat? scripts written by Marco Baroni et al for acquiring corpora from the Internet). WeBoCa? will allow users to create a corpus from a range of search engines, and then conduct processing on the corpus in order to tidy up / manipulate the corpus in a range of ways.

The BootCat? scripts are of great interest to linguists, translators and anyone researching such techniques for academic purposes.

While the main goal of JBootCat was 'to encapsulate the BootCat? functionality within a user-friendly desktop application', WeBoCa? looks to improve upon the open-source application, and increase its functionality in terms of both corpus collection, and knowledge discovery from within the corpus created.

The application currently allows for:
  * Corpus creation using the Google API
  * Knowledge discovery within the corpus
  * Many more features to be added soon...
